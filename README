Example:
--------
./get_qualscreened_file.py https://airsl2.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data//Aqua_AIRS_Level2/AIRS2RET.006/2018/123/AIRS.2018.05.03.203.L2.RetStd_IR.v6.0.31.0.G18124130912.hdf

Overview:
---------
VariableSelection.py is a configuration file
get_qualscreened_file.py is the main, driver script

Format:
-------
NetCDF or HDF
Use DQSS_FORMAT in VariableSelection.py

Product:
--------
AIRX2RET, AIRS2RET, or AIRH2RET
Use PRODUCT_SHORTNAME in VariableSelection.py
 
All of the variables can be used with AIRX2RET, and AIRH2RET.
Those that are not in AIRS2RET are commented like:
  "totH2OMWOnlyStd",         # Moisture * not in AIRS


Variables:
----------
To run DQSS on a variable, edit VariableSelection.py,
cut and paste the variable,comma and comment from the
donotinclude() section to the best, good, or noscreening sections(tuples)

Example:
Have this snippet from the VariableSelection.py change from

best=(
  )

donotinclude(
# Moisture:16 
  "totH2OStd",               # Moisture
  "H2OMMRSat",               # Moisture
  "RelHumSurf",              # Moisture
  "totH2OMWOnlyStd",         # Moisture * not in AIRS
....
)

change to: --->

best=(
  "totH2OStd",               # Moisture
  "H2OMMRSat",               # Moisture
  "RelHumSurf",              # Moisture
  "totH2OMWOnlyStd",         # Moisture * not in AIRS
  )

donotinclude(
# Moisture:16 
....
)

This will screen these four variables accordingly.

The comments are there to help the user restore the configuration file, VariableSelection.py, 
to it's original state.


These items are displayed and should correspond to your selections:
best:                   1
good:                   0
noscreening:            0
donotinclude:           40
ancillary include:         10
ancillary donotinclude:    49
Sanity checks:
screenable should be:41 and is:41
ancillary  should be:59 and is:59
